FSMK Summer Camp 2015
=====================

Free Software Movement Karnataka (FSMK) is planning a 7 days Industry Orientation workshop during the summer break on preparing students on Free Software technologies for the industry. Currently, the industry is actively adopting free software to reduce the cost and have much more freedom to modify the software to suit their needs. This has resulted in its's growing need for software professionals with expertise in free software technologies. This workshop is to ensure that students are trained on various free software technologies so that they are better prepared for the industry. 

It will be a hands-on workshop where students will gain knowledge on various areas like GNU/Linux, Android, Networking in Linux, arduino etc. The sessions will be facilitated by industry professionals with vast and varied work experience. At the end of the workshop, students will be equipped with knowledge of free software & hardware technologies in various domains so that they can choose whichever domain they are interested in and start working on it right during the college days.
